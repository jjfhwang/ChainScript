# ChainScript

Automated crypto trading strategies, backtesting, and live execution platform.

ChainScript is a robust and flexible platform built in Rust designed to automate cryptocurrency trading strategies. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for backtesting strategies against historical data, optimizing parameters, and executing trades live on various cryptocurrency exchanges. ChainScript aims to empower traders with the ability to create, test, and deploy sophisticated trading algorithms with ease and confidence.

* **Backtesting Engine:** Rigorously test your trading strategies against historical market data to evaluate performance and identify potential weaknesses. ChainScript's backtesting engine supports various timeframes, data sources, and performance metrics.
* **Strategy Optimization:** Fine-tune your trading strategies by automatically optimizing parameters using advanced optimization algorithms. This feature helps you discover the optimal settings for your strategies under different market conditions.
* **Live Execution:** Seamlessly deploy your backtested and optimized strategies to live trading environments. ChainScript supports multiple cryptocurrency exchanges and provides real-time market data integration.
* **Risk Management:** Implement robust risk management controls to protect your capital. ChainScript allows you to define stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, and position sizing rules.
* **Modular Architecture:** ChainScript's modular design allows for easy extension and customization. You can add new exchanges, data sources, and trading strategies as needed.

To install ChainScript and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Rust:** If you don't have Rust installed, download and install it from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Ensure you have `rustc` and `cargo` installed.

2.  **Clone the Repository:** Clone the ChainScript repository from GitHub:
    

3.  **Install Dependencies:** ChainScript relies on several crates. Install them using Cargo:
    
    This command will download and compile all necessary dependencies defined in the `Cargo.toml` file.  Ensure you have a stable internet connection during this process.

4.  **Environment Variables:** Configure your environment variables. You may need to set API keys for exchanges. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following (replace with your actual keys):
    
    You might need to install a crate like `dotenv` to load these variables.

5.  **Database Setup (Optional):** If you plan to use database features for storing backtesting results or other data, set up your database and configure the connection string in the `.env` file. For example, using PostgreSQL:
    
    And install the necessary postgres crate: `cargo add postgres`

Here are a few examples of how to use ChainScript:

1.  **Backtesting a Simple Moving Average Strategy:**
    

2.  **Running a Live Trading Bot (Example - Requires Exchange Implementation):**
    
    **Note:** These examples are simplified and require actual implementations for data loading, exchange client, and strategy logic. You'll need to adapt them to your specific needs. Remember to handle errors and implement proper security measures when working with live trading. The `chainscript` namespace is assumed to be the name of your crate.
